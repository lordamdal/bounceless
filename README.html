# BOUNCELESS Email Verification Script Documentation

### Script Purpose and Functionality

This script is designed to help you filter your email list effectively. Maintaining a positive reputation for your email server is crucial, and this tool assists in achieving that by identifying and removing invalid email addresses.

### Why It's Important

Receiving bounce-backs due to misspelled email addresses can be frustrating and time-consuming to address. This script streamlines the process by detecting these incorrect addresses through domain DNS checks (e.g., example@domaintocheck.com). 

### How It Works

1. **Domain DNS Check**: The script first verifies the domain of each email address.
2. **SMTP Validation**: Then, it uses SMTP validation to ensure the email addresses are valid.

By following these steps, you can minimize bounce rates due to invalid email addresses.

### Educational Use Only

This script is intended for educational purposes. It demonstrates the process of cleaning an email list to maintain server reputation and efficiency.

### Future Updates

The next update will include a feature that checks email profile photos to identify highly active internet users, adding another layer of filtering.

### Compliance Reminder

Always adhere to the CAN-SPAM Act of January 2004 when sending emails. This legislation sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, and gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them.

The Email Verification Script is a versatile Python tool designed to verify the validity of email addresses stored in a CSV file. It offers two modes of verification: DNS-based verification and SMTP-based verification. Never get bounced emails again. It's free!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `dnspython`, `validate_email_address`, `csv`, `argparse`, `logging`, and `smtplib` Python libraries.

## Usage

### Installation:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install the required Python libraries using pip or pip3:

```bash
pip3 install dnspython validate_email_address
```

### Running the Script:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python checker.py -f <input_file_path> -o <output_file_path> -m <mode>
```

### Command-line Arguments:

- `-f, --input_file`: Specifies the input CSV file path containing email addresses to be verified.
- `-o, --output_file`: Specifies the output CSV file path for storing verification results.
- `-m, --mode`: Specifies the verification mode. Choose between `dns` (DNS-based verification) or `smtp` (SMTP-based verification). Default mode is `dns`.

## Example

Suppose you have a CSV file named `emails.csv` containing a list of email addresses. To verify these email addresses using DNS and store the results in a file named `verification_results.csv`, you would run the following command:

```bash
python checker.py -f emails.csv -o verification_results.csv -m dns
```

## Note:

- Please ensure that you have appropriate permissions to read from the input CSV file and write to the output CSV file.
- Use the appropriate verification mode (`dns` or `smtp`) based on your requirements and the constraints of the email verification process.
- SMTP verification may be resource-intensive and subject to limitations imposed by mail servers. Use it judiciously to avoid issues with server restrictions.
- The best pattern is to run a DNS verification first then reclean the output list with the SMTP mode.
