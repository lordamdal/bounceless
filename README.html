==================================================

Introduction:

This script is for educational Purpose only

  

The Email Verification Script is a versatile Python tool designed to verify the validity of email addresses stored in a CSV file. It offers two modes of verification: DNS-based verification and SMTP-based verification. Never Get Bounced emails again. It's Free

Requirements:

\- Python 3.x

\- \`dnspython\`, \`validate\_email\_address\`, \`csv\`, \`argparse\`, \`logging\`, and \`smtplib\` Python libraries.

Usage:

1\. **Installation:**

*   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   Install the required Python libraries using pip or pip3:

    pip3 install dnspython validate_email_address

2\. **Running the Script:**

*   Open a terminal or command prompt.
*   Navigate to the directory containing the script.
*   Run the script using the following command:

    python checker.py -f <input_file_path> -o <output_file_path> -m <mode>

3\. **Command-line Arguments:**

Show Command-line Arguments

\- `-f, --input_file`: Specifies the input CSV file path containing email addresses to be verified.

\- `-o, --output_file`: Specifies the output CSV file path for storing verification results.

\- `-m, --mode`: Specifies the verification mode. Choose between `dns` (DNS-based verification) or `smtp` (SMTP-based verification). Default mode is `dns`.

Example:

Suppose you have a CSV file named `emails.csv` containing a list of email addresses. To verify these email addresses using DNS and store the results in a file named `verification_results.csv`, you would run the following command:

    python checker.py -f emails.csv -o verification_results.csv -m dns

Note:

\- Please ensure that you have appropriate permissions to read from the input CSV file and write to the output CSV file.

\- Use the appropriate verification mode (`dns` or `smtp`) based on your requirements and the constraints of the email verification process.

\- SMTP verification may be resource-intensive and subject to limitations imposed by mail servers. Use it judiciously to avoid issues with server restrictions.

  

\- The best pattern is to run a DNS verification first then reclean the output list with the SMTP mode.
